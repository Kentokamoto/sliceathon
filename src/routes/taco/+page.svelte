		`Many years ago, on the ocho-th day, of the ocho-th month, at ocho o’clock Mountain
     Time, a traveler was making his way from Northgate to Capitol Hill, in search of the
     perfect street taco. As he was beginning to lose hope, he saw the distinct shadow of a food
     truck. Knowing he’d never make it there on time walking, he began to run. Tired, hungry and 
     full love, the traveler began to sing as he arrived at the taco truck. Knowing they might 
     be closed, he looked deep into his heart and these were the words that came out: “no rompas 
     mas, mi pobre corazón”, which translates to “don’t break my poor heart anymore”. Hearing 
     this, the taco truck operator smiled and reopened for the traveler.`,
		`This year, we will honor the traveler’s great conquest by running, eating tacos and 
     singing “no rompas mas, mi pobre corazón”.  Whether you enjoy running, eating tacos or 
     spontaneous singing and line dancing, this race has got a little something for everyone.
     Looking forward to seeing you there at 7:00 PM Pacific Time on August 8th`
