    Slice-A-Thon is Born!
  </h1>
  <p class="mb-3">
    While the exact moment and who said what is still unclear, one thing is for
    certain – slice-a-thon was born on a cool fall evening in Seattle. A group
    of friends were gathered at a bar after completing a weekly run around the
    Fremont neighborhood. As the drinks and pretzels were flowing, the
    conversation bounced back and forth between two of the group’s favorite
    topics – pizza and running. There was discussion about which style reigns
    supreme, upcoming races and the genius that is pizza by the slice.

    As the night carried on, the two conversations slowly moved closer and
    closer together until someone finally said “well, couldn’t we do both?” And
    just like that, the clouds parted, a rainbow emerged across the sky and a
    cat and a dog high-fived, all as if to emphatically say “yes, we can do
    both!”

  <p class="mb-3">
    From there, the friends began drawing up the plans for the first annual
    slice-a-thon. The vision was to create a uniquely fun race, where
    participants would run a half marathon distance while also stopping at some
    local pizza by the slice places along the way. Essentially run, eat, repeat
    until the finish line.

    If you’ve been eating pizza and going for occasional runs, this is the event
    you’ve been training your whole life for. And if you’ve never done one or
    both of those things, you’re especially in for a treat. The road to
    slice-a-thon glory is paved in sauce and cheese.
